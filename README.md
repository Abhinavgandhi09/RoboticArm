# RoboticArm
This is a crowd controlled robotic arm. The hardware for this project has been taken from another open source project, which can be found here - https://github.com/phenoptix/meArm-1.
The arm can be controlled by a large number of people simultaneously over the web, by using a web based form to submit their choices. It is used to study human robot interaction and the efficiency of humans as a team.
The arm has been laser cut using 3.5mm thick acrylic. I used black color acrylic because that's what was available. You can go ahead and use any color that pleases you.
I built the hardware for the robot at MIT's Engineering Design Studio(EDS) and would like to thank the nice folks at EDS who helped me out with various aspects of the project. The project was built under the mentorship of Dr. Kyle Keane, a lecturer at the Department of Material Science and Engineering(DMSE), MIT and was demonstrated at an IAP class - <a="http://weller.mit.edu/iap/">Collaborative Design using Arduino</a> where I was helping as a TA.
