# RoboticArm
This is a repository for a crowd controlled robotic arm. The hardware for this project has been taken from another open source project, which can be found here - https://github.com/phenoptix/meArm-1.
The arm can be controlled by a large number of people simultaneously over the web, by using a web based form to submit their choices. It is used to study human robot interaction and the efficiency of humans as a team.
